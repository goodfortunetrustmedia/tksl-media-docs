## Creating new video

### Create

3. Click Create > Upload Videos

### Upload

### Edit Details

   - Type in the Video Title
   - Type in Description
   - Select a thumbnail image (optional)
   - Select under “Audience” that “No, it’s not made for kids”

<img src={useBaseUrl('img/video-upload/audience.png')} />

6. Click next, and click next again to skip (2) Video elements – you don’t need to fill anything out here
7. On the Visibility Screen – make sure “Unlisted” is selected otherwise the video will become public.

   - Note: don’t select private otherwise no one will be able to view it without manually adding users.

### Save

8. Click “Save” and leave the window open as the video will continue to upload. You can close any pop ups – just not the browser. Once the video is fully uploaded, you can close the browser.

### Create Link

9. Copy the “Video Link” as we will need that to set up the TKSL video link.

   - See the section on [linking video](video-link.md)
