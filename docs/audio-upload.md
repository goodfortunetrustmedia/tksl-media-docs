## Naming Convention

Name all audio files with the following strict format:

`yyyymmdd - Teacher - Name of Course - Lecture #.mp3`

If it is a multi-session day, indicate the number of days and number of sessions as below.

`yyyymmdd - Teacher - Name of Course - Day # of # - Session #.mp3`

The purpose of naming these files in this structured way allows for easier navigation and automated processing in future.
