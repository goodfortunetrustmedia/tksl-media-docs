## Location of the saved files

To find the location where the video files are saved follow these steps:

2. Select Audio Settings

## Uploading audio only

Zoom records both an audio and a video file. Note it is in .m4a format and it is ok to leave it in this format.

Make sure to rename the audio as per the [Naming Convention](./audio-upload#naming-convention).

Select the audio file and upload that as per the [Uploading Audio](./audio-upload) process.
