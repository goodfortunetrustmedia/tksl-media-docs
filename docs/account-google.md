## Permissions

Logging into the google account can only be done by admin. If you are looking for access please contact Ven Pema for details.

Before you begin this is only possible using Chrome Browser. Use the Chrome browser to complete this process.

## Enabling Login Account in Chrome

   <img src={useBaseUrl('img/account-google/sign_in_3.png')} />
   <img src={useBaseUrl('img/account-google/sign_in_4.png')} />

4. Confirm that you have signed into the account

   Once you have signed in, when clicking the top right menu, the GFTMedia account should be selected.

## Uploading Under the Google Account

Google counts upload quota under the selected account at the time of upload. Ensure that when uploading files the "GFTMedia" account is selected in the top right, otherwise storage quota will be counted under your own personal account.

The opposite is the case too, if you upload a personal file under the GFTMedia account, the quota will be counted under the GFTMedia account.

1. First 100% make sure you are logged into the Google account (as shown above) by switching using the user menu in the top right (if you aren't already in the account).

2. Navigate to the google drive

3. Drag and drop files into the google drive, while having the GFTMedia account selected.
